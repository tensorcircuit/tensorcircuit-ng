**Welcome and congratulations! You have found TensorCircuit: the Next Generation.** üëè 


Introduction
---------------

`TensorCircuit-NG <https://github.com/tensorcircuit/tensorcircuit-ng>`_ is an open-source high-performance quantum software framework in Python.

* It is built for humans. üëΩ

* It is designed for speed, flexibility and elegance. üöÄ

* It is empowered by advanced tensor network simulator engines. üîã

* It is ready for quantum hardware access with CPU/GPU/QPU (local/cloud) hybrid solutions. üñ•

* It is implemented with industry-standard machine learning frameworks: TensorFlow, JAX, and PyTorch. ü§ñ

* It is flexible and powerful to build and simulate tensor networks, neural networks and quantum circuits together. üß†

* It is compatible with machine learning engineering paradigms: automatic differentiation, just-in-time compilation, vectorized parallelism and GPU acceleration. üõ†

With the help of TensorCircuit-NG, now get ready to efficiently and elegantly solve interesting and challenging quantum computing and quantum many-body problems: from academic research prototype to industry application deployment.

.. important::
   Please cite the `whitepaper <https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2023-02-02-912/>`_ when using TensorCircuit or TensorCircuit-NG in your research. The bibtex information is provided by ``tc.cite()``.

.. note::
   The TensorCircuit package is outdated. 
   We recommend upgrading to TensorCircuit-NG for the latest features and improvements. 
   You can upgrade by running the following command:
   ``pip uninstall tensorcircuit && pip install tensorcircuit-ng``
